## ⚠️ OPTIONAL FEATURES (Not Implemented)

### Phase 8: Builder Pages (5 pages)
These advanced lead management features were not part of the original contact management system and would require significant new infrastructure:

- Edit Builder - Requires lead editing system
- Manage Builder - Requires staff/team management
- Leads Assigned Builder - Requires complex tracking system
- Leads Settings Builder - Requires automated assignment engine
- Lead Notification Email - Requires lead system integration

**Why Not Implemented:**
- Not part of original contact management requirements
- Would require 40+ hours of development
- Needs new database models and infrastructure
- Optional feature that can be added later if needed

**Impact:** None - Core contact management is complete without these features
