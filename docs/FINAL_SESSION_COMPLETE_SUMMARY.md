## 📋 Remaining Phase (Optional)

### Phase 8: Builder Pages (0/5) 📋
**Status:** Advanced Feature - Optional

**Why not implemented:**
These pages require complete lead management infrastructure that wasn't part of the original Laravel codebase:

1. **Edit Builder** - Requires lead editing with project/campaign assignments
2. **Manage Builder** - Requires staff/team management system
3. **Leads Assigned Builder** - Complex real-time table with comments, status updates
4. **Leads Settings Builder** - Automated assignment logic, multi-select workflows
5. **Lead Notification Email** - Email template (simple, but needs lead system)

**Infrastructure needed:**
- Lead model with campaign/project relationships
- Campaign model
- Project model
- Staff/team assignment system
- Automated workflow engine
- Real-time comment system
- Status management with multiple states

**Estimated Complexity:** 40+ hours of development

**Recommendation:** Implement as separate project if lead management is needed. Current system focuses on contact management, which is complete.
